# **App Name**: EcoVision

## Core Features:

- Data Collection Dashboard: A dashboard for factories to input their machine electricity usage, fuel consumption data, and production data.
- Carbon Emission Calculation: Calculate total CO2 emissions based on the data provided using standard emission factors.
- AI-Based Pattern Analysis: Analyze peak usage hours, idle machine time, inefficient machines, and abnormal energy spikes using regression models, time-series analysis, and anomaly detection. Uses the 'tool' abstraction in LLM
- Smart Recommendation Engine: Suggest actions to reduce idle runtime, optimize temperature settings, shift load to off-peak hours, improve insulation, and replace inefficient motors.
- Closed-Loop Monitoring: Recalculate emissions after changes are applied and show before/after optimization results.
- Reporting and Certification Support: Generate reports to aid in green certification processes and showcase environmental impact.
- Blockchain Verification (Optional): Offer an optional layer of blockchain verification for emissions data to enhance trust and transparency.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep forest green (#228B22) to represent environmental focus and sustainability.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#F0FAF0) for a clean and calming interface.
- Accent color: Warm yellow (#FFD700) to highlight recommendations and key metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern, neutral, and readable interface.
- Use minimalist, eco-themed icons to represent data and recommendations.
- Clean and intuitive dashboard layout for easy data input and visualization.
- Subtle transitions and animations to guide users through the optimization process.
